## Installation

The installation ivolved showing the time and date utilizing moment.js, changing the html elements to match current time.
 By adding to the HTML with timeblocks, I made the the file correspond with the Javascript code. The timeblocks were made for standard business hours from 8 AM- 5 PM. Used save a button to add a listener with jquery to shorten the length of the code. To save the text and time and time in local storage the set item to the local storage. I looped time blocks and used an if statement to ensure the background colors corresponded with the current time. Finally, I added the hours to local storage with jQuery format.


## Usage

Screenshots including the bootstrap time blocks of the HTML and moment format for time and date.
